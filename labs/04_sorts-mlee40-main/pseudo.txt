Bubble Sort:
Create a nested for loop iterating through each element of the array.
If the element at index i is greater than the element at index i+1, switch the two elements.
Loop through the array again, excluding the last element by setting second iterator less than (array length - first iterator - 1).
Print array for each iteration of first for loop.

Insertion Sort:
Create a nested while loop inside of a for loop iterating through each element of the array.
For each element at array[i], check if its value is smaller than the element at array[i-1]. If it is, switch the two elements. Repeat this process (in the while loop) until array[i-1] <= array[i], for which you leave the values where they are.
Loop through the array again, excluding the last element by setting second iterator less than (array length - first iterator - 1).
Print array for each iteration of first for loop.

Selection Sort:
Create a nested for loop iterating through each element of the array.
	In the outer for loop, begin index i = 0, and in the inner for loop, have index j = i
Set min_index to i
If the element at index i is greater than the element at index j, set min_index to j.
Switch the values at index i and at index min_index.
Print array for each iteration of first for loop.
