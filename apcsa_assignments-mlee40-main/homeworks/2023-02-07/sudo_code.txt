1. read the first line and find the number of rows and columns in the array
2. create an array with the trees and pastures (using the size of the array given beforehand)
3. using recursion, which tells the cow to avoid trees or empty space on either 4 directions, create a 2d array of all possible paths with designated path length.
4. loop through the arrays and remove the ones with stars (trees) in them.
5. count the number of remaining paths.
